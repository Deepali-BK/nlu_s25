        "# HW 2: Efficient Fine-Tuning with BitFit?\n",
        "**Due: March 13, 11:30 AM**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework assignment, you will replicate [the BitFit experiments (Zaken et al., 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.1/). You will first use the [🤗 Transformers framework](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to fine-tune a [BERT$_\\text{tiny}$ model](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny) ([Turc et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962); [Bhargava et al., 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.insights-1.18/)) on the IMDb dataset. You will then fine-tune the same model, but with all parameters frozen other than the bias terms. You will compare the two models on the following metrics: (1) their accuracy on the IMDb test set and (2) the number of parameters trained during fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important: Read Before Starting\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will need to implement functions defined in the `train_model.py` and `test_model.py` scripts. **Please write all your code in those files.** You should not submit this notebook with your solutions, and we will not grade it if you do. Please be aware that code written in a Jupyter notebook may run differently when copied into Python modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outputs shown in this notebook are the outputs that you should get **when all problems have been completed correctly**. You may obtain different results if you attempt to run the code cells before you have completed the problem set, or if you have completed one or more problems incorrectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "For part of this assignment, you will be asked to fine-tune a BERT$_\\text{tiny}$ model on the IMDb dataset with hyperparameter tuning. **This will take several hours to run on a laptop with a CPU.** You may want to instead run your code on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) using a free GPU.\n",
