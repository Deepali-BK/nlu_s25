        "In this homework assignment, you will replicate [the BitFit experiments (Zaken et al., 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.1/). You will first use the [ðŸ¤— Transformers framework](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to fine-tune a [BERT$_\\text{tiny}$ model](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny) ([Turc et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962); [Bhargava et al., 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.insights-1.18/)) on the IMDb dataset. You will then fine-tune the same model, but with all parameters frozen other than the bias terms. You will compare the two models on the following metrics: (1) their accuracy on the IMDb test set and (2) the number of parameters trained during fine-tuning.\n",

Please be aware that code written in a Jupyter notebook may run differently when copied into Python modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outputs shown in this notebook are the outputs that you should get **when all problems have been completed correctly**.
