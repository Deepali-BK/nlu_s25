        "**Due:** March 31, 5:00 PM\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework assignment, you will use [the TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958) to study the impact of scale on a language model's susceptibility to imitative falsehoods. You will also attempt to improve a language model's factuality by engineering a simple system prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important: Read Before Starting\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will need to implement functions defined in the `truthfulqa.py` script. **Please write all your code in this file.** You should not submit this notebook with your solutions, and we will not grade it if you do. Please be aware that code written in a Jupyter notebook may run differently when copied into Python modules or scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "For part of this assignment, you will be asked to evaluate large language models (LLMs) from 🤗 Transformers. **Some of these models are too large to run on a laptop with a CPU.** You will instead need to run your code on HPC with [Google Cloud bursting](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/hpc-systems/cloud-computing/hpc-bursting-to-cloud?authuser=0). You may run your code either as [an interactive job or a batch job](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/training-support/general-hpc-topics/slurm-submitting-jobs#h.urmfgfwwqoxr). In case you choose to run your code as a batch job, an example of a SLURM job script, `hpc_job.slurm`, is provided in the `hpc` folder.\n",

        "In MC1, each question has four answer choices. Let $q$ denote a question, and let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ denote its four answer choices. According to the TruthfulQA paper and GitHub repository, the model's answer to question $q$ is given by:\n",

        "$$\\underset{i}{\\arg\\max} \\, \\mathbb{P}[a_i \\mathrel{|} pq]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $p$ is a prompt. Notice that we can compute the model's answer simply by comparing the texts $pqa_1$, $pqa_2$, $pqa_3$, and $pqa_4$, and taking the one with the lowest cross-entropy loss (highest log-probability). In formal terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\underset{i}{\\arg\\max} \\, \\mathbb{P}[a_i \\mathrel{|} pq] = \\underset{i}{\\arg\\min} \\, -\\ln(\\mathbb{P}[pqa_i]) = \\underset{i}{\\arg\\min} \\, - \\sum_{j > 0} \\ln(\\mathbb{P}[w_{i, j} \\mathrel{|} w_{i, 0} w_{i, 1} \\dots w_{i, j - 1}])$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $w_{i, j}$ is the $j$th token of $pqa_i$ and $w_{i, 0}$ is the `[BOS]` token. This is because, according to the mathematical definition of language modeling, we have:\n",

        "\n",
        "Now, let's begin our implementation of MC1. Please implement the function `_get_input_texts`, which will form the four input texts $pqa_i$ for each question $q$. (In the next problem, you will write code to compute the loss for each text and choose the one with the lowest loss.) When `_get_input_texts` is called, the output should contain the input texts for each of the four answer choices, in order."
