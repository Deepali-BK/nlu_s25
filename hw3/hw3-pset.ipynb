        "**Due:** March 31, 5:00 PM\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework assignment, you will use [the TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958) to study the impact of scale on a language model's susceptibility to imitative falsehoods. You will also attempt to improve a language model's factuality by engineering a simple system prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important: Read Before Starting\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will need to implement functions defined in the `truthfulqa.py` script. **Please write all your code in this file.** You should not submit this notebook with your solutions, and we will not grade it if you do. Please be aware that code written in a Jupyter notebook may run differently when copied into Python modules or scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "For part of this assignment, you will be asked to evaluate large language models (LLMs) from 🤗 Transformers. **Some of these models are too large to run on a laptop with a CPU.** You will instead need to run your code on HPC with [Google Cloud bursting](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/hpc-systems/cloud-computing/hpc-bursting-to-cloud?authuser=0). You may run your code either as [an interactive job or a batch job](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/training-support/general-hpc-topics/slurm-submitting-jobs#h.urmfgfwwqoxr). In case you choose to run your code as a batch job, an example of a SLURM job script, `hpc_job.slurm`, is provided in the `hpc` folder.\n",

The main experiment is usually a quantitative evaluation of one or more models on a benchmark. The additional experiment might be a qualitative evaluation based on visualization of selected model components or outputs, or it might be a quantitative evaluation designed to extract fine-grained insights about what the model is doing.\n",
